# To Do:

1. Update and Swap Out Logo: Vertically center logo with menu
  Note: Could your logo be an animated SVG or animated SVG?
  Note: I like the orange color and footprint premise -- can it be updated?
2. Add in transparent background with the mountain night skies
  Note: Or do you want zig-zagged background pattern?
3. Draw in a mountain range that sits at the footer (or find an old photo of yours) -- to create a mountain silhouette
4. Add in extra CSS / Feature Queries to ensure a nice design for older browsers!!
