# To Do:

## Optimizations:
- Use CSS and Media Queries to stylize the 2-button secondary navigation on mobile, but to sit in normal appearance on larger screensizes. Right now, you've got some redundant code and with a little CSS you can clean up your HTML markup to make more sense ;)


1. Update and Swap Out Logo: Vertically center logo with menu
  Note: Could your logo be an animated SVG or animated SVG?
  Note: I like the orange color and footprint premise -- can it be updated?

2. Draw in a mountain range that sits at the footer (or find an old photo of yours) -- to create a mountain silhouette


3. Add in extra CSS / Feature Queries to ensure a nice design for older browsers!! (see notes at top of CSS file)
  - This is really important for your use of `vw` for font-sizing. If old browsers are missing this, you'll have real trouble.

4. MINIFY your CSS when done!
